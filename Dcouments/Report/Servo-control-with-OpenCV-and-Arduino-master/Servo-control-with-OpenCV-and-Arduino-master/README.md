# Servo-control-with-OpenCV-and-Arduino

This simple project is about controlling multiple servos with Arduino and OpenCV Python. In this project two servos are attached for x and y axial movements. Python is tracking my face with Haar cascade classifier and sending x and y coordinates of the center of my face to the Arduino, and the Arduino is writing those coordinates to the axial servos. That is making the servos move to the desired position.

Here x axial servo is connected with pin 9 and the y axial servo in pin 10
